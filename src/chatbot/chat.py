This module implements the main chatbot interface using Gradio's ChatInterface. It provides
the user interface and handles the interaction between the user and the chatbot service.

The module includes:
- Chat class: Main chatbot interface that handles user interactions, file uploads, and
  conversation management
- File upload functionality: Allows users to upload PDF documents for the chatbot to use
  as knowledge sources
- Conversation management: Maintains chat history and manages the flow of conversations
- Integration with chat services: Connects to the backend chat service for generating
  responses based on the conversation context

The Chat class extends Gradio's ChatInterface to provide a user-friendly interface with
the following features:
- Multimodal input (text and file uploads)
- Conversation history management
- Integration with the chat service for generating responses
- Error handling for file uploads and chat interactions

Key components:
- ChatInterface: Base class from Gradio for building chatbot interfaces
- chat_service: Backend service that handles the actual conversation processing
- Conversation: Data structure for managing chat history and configuration
- Message: Data structure for individual chat messages
